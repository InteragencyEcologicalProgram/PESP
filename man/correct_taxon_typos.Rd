\title{Correct Taxon Names Using a Typo Lookup Table}
\usage{
correct_taxon_typos(df, read_func = read_quiet_csv)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Dataframe containing a \code{Taxon} column to correct}
}
\value{
Dataframe with corrected \code{Taxon} values and a \code{log} attribute containing
a dataframe named \code{taxon_corrections} listing original and corrected names
}
\description{
Corrects known taxon name typos based on an external lookup table.
Handles \code{cf.} qualifiers by temporarily removing them
during matching and re-inserting them afterward in their original position.
Also standardizes malformed \code{cf.} and \code{sp.} affixes before correction.

Specifically:
\itemize{
\item Normalizes all names to ASCII before comparison
\item Standardizes affixes \code{cf}, \code{sp}, and \code{var} to consistent forms
\item Performs exact case-insensitive matches against the typo correction table
\item Reattaches \code{cf.} qualifiers to corrected names
}
}
