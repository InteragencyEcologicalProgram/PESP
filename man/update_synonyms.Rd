\title{Update Taxon Names To Current Synonyms}
\usage{
update_synonyms(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Dataframe containing a \code{Taxon} column of names to standardize}
}
\value{
Dataframe with updated \code{Taxon} names, a new \code{OrigTaxon} column showing
previous values (NA if unchanged), and a \code{log} attribute listing all
synonym updates.
}
\description{
Resolves and updates outdated taxon names based on a synonym chain defined
in external phytoplankton taxonomy metadata (\code{read_phyto_taxa()}). Handles
both standard and \code{cf.} forms (e.g., \code{"Genus cf. species"}), replacing each
with its current accepted name while preserving the original.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Synonym chains are traced iteratively until a terminal name
(\code{CurrentTaxon == "None"}) is reached.
\item \code{cf.} names are normalized, resolved, and reconstructed in the same format.
\item Circular references are skipped safely.
\item Uses memoization for faster repeated lookups.
